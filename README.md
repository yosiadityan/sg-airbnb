# Singapore's Airbnb Price Predictor

## Problem Statement
Who doesn't like to travel? Traveling is a such fun activity, coming into new place and experience many new things. It is a part of crucial aspect in life as it's the best way to escape from hectic and busy schedule. It also improves the mental and physical health while it's a good remedy for stress, anxiety and depression. As part of travelling, deciding accomodation or where you should sleep and charge your body is definitely important thing to decide. One of the choice to spend your night, apart from conventional hotel is Airbnb.

Airbnb is an American vacation rental online marketplace company based in San Francisco, California. Airbnb maintains and hosts a marketplace, accessible to consumers on its website or via an app. Through the service, users can arrange lodging, primarily homestays, and tourism experiences or list their properties for rental. Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties; instead, it profits by receiving commission from each booking. 

Singapore, one of developed country in Asia, make 4.1% of its national GDP from tourism industry alone and has been one of the most visited country in Asia resulting in thousand of Airbnb listings in Singapore (around 4000+ listings). It can be troublesome to choose one befitting your needs and budget. This also becomes problem for owner property who wants to register their new property in Airbnb since they may find it hard to price their property.

Here's where machine learning help to solve those problems. Predicting price of property, or in this case Airbnb listing, could be quite challenging since there are various factors need to be measured and calculated in order to get price accurately. In this project, we will do end-to-end machine learning project, starting from cleaning the dataset, do exploratory data analysis to get some insights, use machine learning model to predict Airbnb listing price and deploy our best model by creating dashboard.


## About Dataset
This dataset is downloaded from Inside Airbnb. Inside Airbnb is an independent, non-commercial set of tools and data that allows you to explore how Airbnb is really being used in cities around the world.
